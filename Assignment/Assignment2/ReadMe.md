# LightCycle Game

The LightCycles game is a classic arcade version of the game "Light Cycles" from the  first  Tron  movie.
It  is  intended  to  be  a  complete  specification  of  what  functionality the game provides.

## Getting Started

* Default lightcycle.client count is set to 2. It strongly to have at least 2 computers to make the game work.

* It is possible to run the game in one laptop but always remember the console server might not be able to
generate accurate results.

Read through instructions and you will have some knowledge on how to run the game.


### Instructions

There are only 2 steps to get the game running and they are as follows:

```
1. Unzip the LightCycles file from the folder and open it using intelliJ.

2. We are only going to run two files: SERVER and CLIENT GUI.

A. Server side
- Run the server. Default client count is 2, but can increase (Depending on the number of players).
* If default count is less, an error message will show.

B. CLIENT GUI
Player 1: Enter username and lightcycles color of choice then press "OK".
Player 2: Enter localhost id of Player 1, your own username and lightcycle color of choice, then press "OK" when done.


Once all is set, then you're ready to play!
```

### Control Keys

Control keys are essential in the light cycles game. If you know how to manipulate the keys, then you will have a
higher chance of winning from your opponent.

```
A = Turn anticlockwise
D = Turn clockwise
W = Go faster
S = Go Slower

```

### Light Cycle Colors

There are limited colors for the light cycles so remember to choose only the following colors:

```
A = Turn anticlockwise
D = Turn clockwise
W = Go faster
S = Go Slower

```
